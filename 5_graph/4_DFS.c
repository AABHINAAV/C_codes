/*
Advantages Of DFS :-
1. Memory requirement is Linear WRT Nodes.
2. Less time and space complexity rather than BFS.
3. Solution can be found out by without much more search.

Disadvantage of DFS :-
1. Not Guaranteed that it will give you solution.
2. Cut-off depth is smaller so time complexity is more.
3. Determination of depth until the search has proceeds.

Applications of DFS:-
1. Finding Connected components.
2. Topological sorting.
3. Finding Bridges of graph.
